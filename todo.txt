CHANGE IF STATEMENT TO CHECK IF PIECE IS UNDER TETRO WHEN TETRO IS OUTSIDE OF 
PLAYGROUND

HANDLE SCALING

GAME LOOP REVISION:

- Check if tetro is spawned:
	if not spawn it;

- store tetro position and rotation at the beginning of the loop

- Check key pressed: moving left - right - going down (if is not grounded) - 
rotation

- Check if new tetro position is clear:
	if not -> restore old values

-Print new tetro location

-Check if grounded and not moved (right-left-rotation) recently:
	if yes -> register as letters in board and spawn new

Need to keep track of last automatic going down and last moved and current time
